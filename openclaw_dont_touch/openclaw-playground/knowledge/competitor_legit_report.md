# The "Legit" Competitor: Synthflow

**The Winner:** **Synthflow** (Albert/Sass)
**The Verdict:** The "Safe" Air.ai. The one that actually works.

## Why They Are Dangerous (The "Good" Competitor)
1.  **They Deliver:** Unlike Air.ai (Scam) and 11x (Fake metrics), Synthflow users actually deploy agents that make calls.
2.  **No-Code:** They cracked the "Business OS" interface. You don't need to be a developer (like with Bland AI) to use it.
3.  **The Sweet Spot:** They target exactly your audience (SMBs/Agencies), not Fortune 500s (like Sierra).

## The Landscape Map
*   **The Scammers:** Air.ai (Caleb Maddix).
*   **The Fakers:** 11x.ai (Hasan Sukkar).
*   **The Enterprise:** Sierra (Bret Taylor) - Too big to care about SMBs.
*   **The Infrastructure:** Bland AI / Retell - Great engines, but no steering wheel.
*   **The Real Deal:** **Synthflow**.

## How We Beat Synthflow
They are "Just Voice".
Link AI is **Omnichannel** (Voice + WhatsApp + CRM + Bank).
Synthflow is a *Phone System*. Link AI is a *Business OS*.
