## 1. The Landscape (Who is really playing?)

We are not competing with Salesforce. We are competing with the **"Digital Worker"** factories.

| Competitor | Positioning | The "Hook" | The Gap (Our Opportunity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11x.ai** | "Automated Digital Workers" | Uses avatars ("Alice", "Jordan") to personify jobs. Sell "SDR" not "Software". | **Siloed.** Alice doesn't talk to Jordan. They are separate apps. They don't have a "Central Brain" (Link). |
| **Sierra** | "Conversational AI Platform" | Trust/Safety first. Founded by ex-Salesforce CEO. Focus on "Brand Safety". | **Corporate & Slow.** They sell to Fortune 500s who need 6 months of legal review. Not for the agile SMB. |
| **Lindy.ai** | "AI Employee for everything" | "I can do anything". Very generic. | **Jack of all trades, master of none.** Often fails at specific, hard tasks (like Israeli Voice Latency). |
| **Hebbia** | "The Matrix for Knowledge" | Reads 1M documents at once. | **Read-Only.** It analyzes, it doesn't *act*. It won't close a deal on WhatsApp. |

## 2. The Strategic Gap: "The Missing OS"

**The Industry Problem:**
Everyone is building **"Point Agents"**.
*   "Here is an agent for Sales."
*   "Here is an agent for Support."
*   "Here is an agent for Legal."

**The Link AI Advantage:**
None of them are building the **Operating System** that connects them.
*   **11x.ai** doesn't give you a "Bro Interface" where you ask: *"Alice sold something, tell Jordan to invoice him."*
*   **Sierra** doesn't let you deploy a private container to your own GCP (Sovereignty).

## 3. How We Win (The Attack Plan)

1.  **The "Director" Pitch:**
    *   Don't just sell "Agents". Sell **"The Management Layer"** (Link).
    *   *Pitch:* "You can hire 5 different AI agents from 5 companies and go crazy managing them. Or you can get Link AI, and HE manages them for you."

2.  **The "Sovereignty" Moat:**
    *   All these competitors run on *their* cloud. Your data is *theirs*.
    *   Link AI runs on **YOUR** cloud (Google Cloud Run). We are the only "Private AI Workforce".

3.  **The "Israeli" Edge:**
    *   Voice Latency in Hebrew is a nightmare for US companies. They don't care about it.
    *   If we crack <500ms Hebrew Voice (with LiveKit/Zep), we own the local market instantly.

**Verdict:**
There is NO direct competitor building a **"Decentralized, Self-Hosted Business OS"**.
We are alone in this lane. Run fast.
