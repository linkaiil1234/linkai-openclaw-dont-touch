# The "Service Trap" Manifesto

**The Problem:**
Clients pay for a **Product** ($5k) but demand **Custom Dev** ($50k).
*   They pay: 5,000 NIS.
*   They demand: "Change everything, change features, 1-to-1 fit."
*   Result: You get stuck, they get angry, business dies.

**The Solution: "Take It or Leave It" (Product Mindset)**

1.  **Define the Box:**
    *   We sell *this* box. It does X, Y, Z.
    *   It does NOT do A, B, C.

2.  **The "Custom" Tax:**
    *   "You want to change a feature? No problem. Custom development starts at $15,000."
    *   (This filters out 99% of the noise immediately).

3.  **The Wizard Strategy:**
    *   Stop building manually. Give them a Wizard.
    *   If the Wizard can't do it -> "The system doesn't support that yet." (Not "I can't do it").
    *   Blame the software, not yourself.

**Immediate Action:**
Refund the 5,000. It's the cost of learning this lesson.
