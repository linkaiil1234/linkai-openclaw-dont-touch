# The Client Crisis Playbook (Anti-Facker Edition)

**Goal:** Reduce founder load to 0% on services, refocus 100% on product.

## Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Immediate)

### 1. The "Async" Wall 🚧
**Protocol:** Kill all synchronous meetings.
**Script:** "To maximize efficiency and focus on results, we are shifting to Async Video updates. No more weekly Zoom calls. Send questions via Loom/Voice Note, I reply by EOD."
**Why:** Reclaims your calendar instantly.

### 2. The "Automated Report" 📊
**Protocol:** Preemptive strike. Send a stat update daily at 08:00 AM.
**Script:** "Good morning! Yesterday: 50 sent, 1 lead. Optimizing today. No action needed."
**Why:** Clients call when they feel in the dark. Light kills the fear.

### 3. The "System Upgrade" Freeze ❄️
**Protocol:** Buy 48 hours of silence.
**Script:** "We are deploying a major engine upgrade. Outreach paused for 48h for migration. Expect silence until Wednesday, then better results."
**Why:** Valid excuse to fix things without nagging.

## Phase 2: Structural Fix (Delegate)

### 4. The "Quality over Quantity" Pivot 🎯
**Protocol:** Change the KPI.
**Script:** "I reviewed the data. Too much noise. I am reducing volume to increase relevance. Fewer leads, but better ones."
**Why:** Stops the "why only 5 leads?" complaint.

### 5. The "Human in the Loop" Patch 👷
**Protocol:** Hire a VA ($5/hr) to QA the AI.
**Action:** Aritra/VA reviews every AI draft before the client sees it.
**Why:** Prevents embarrassing AI hallucinations.

## Phase 3: The Endgame (Pivot)

### 6. The "SOP" Handover 📦
**Protocol:** Turn Service into Product.
**Offer:** "Here is the 'Link AI' system we built for you (prompts + lists). Run it in-house for free, or pay a small software fee. I am stepping out of the loop."

### 7. The "Beta Partner" Reframe 🤝
**Protocol:** Shift from Vendor to Partner.
**Script:** "We are becoming a Product company. You can stay as a 'Design Partner' (cheap software, buggy), or leave. We don't do agency services anymore."

### 8. The "Refund & Refer" ✂️
**Protocol:** Fire the bottom 20%.
**Script:** "We are restructuring. I can no longer support this account. Refund processed. Good luck."
