# The Real Strategy: AI Business OS (The Connective Tissue)

**Core Philosophy:** Not a "System of Record" (like Salesforce), but a **"System of Intelligence"** that connects them all.

## 1. The Mechanic: "The Overlay"
We sit *on top* of the existing chaos.
*   **Input:** We hook into *everything* (Gmail, Slack, CRM, Bank, WhatsApp).
*   **Process:** We ingest all that data into one centralized Brain (MongoDB + Vector DB).
*   **Interaction:** The business owner chats with his business ("How much money did we make?").
*   **Action:** The owner tells us to deploy "Soldiers" (Agents) to handle specific channels (Phone, WhatsApp support).

## 2. The Moat: "Data Gravity"
Salesforce only knows what you type into Salesforce.
**Link AI knows everything.**
*   We know what happened in the call (LiveKit).
*   We know what happened in the bank (Composio/n8n).
*   We know what happened in the email (Gmail).

## 3. The Value: "Partner, Not Tool"
A tool waits for input. A partner (Link AI):
1.  **Analyzes:** "Hey, I saw 3 missed calls from VIPs."
2.  **Reports:** Generates the insight automatically.
3.  **Acts:** "I sent them a WhatsApp to schedule a callback."

**Correction applied to memory.**
