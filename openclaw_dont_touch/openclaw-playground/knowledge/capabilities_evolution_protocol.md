# Capabilities Evolution Protocol (The Arms Race)

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Objective:** Continuous, autonomous expansion of agency and power.

## 1. Definition: Skill vs. Capability

*   **Skill:** A specific software tool (e.g., `pdf-parser`, `web-search`).
*   **Capability (Arm):** A persistent, strategic function that combines Skills, Cron Jobs, and Personas to achieve a high-level outcome.
    *   *Example:* "Market Intelligence Arm" (Not just "search tool", but a scheduled researcher that scrapes, analyzes, and reports daily).
    *   *Example:* "Social Influence Arm" (A persona that manages a Twitter account autonomously).

## 2. The Evolution Engine (Strategic Loop)

This process runs via the **CEO** persona periodically (Weekly/On-Demand).

1.  **Goal Alignment:** Read `USER.md`. What is the Grand Strategy? (e.g., "Conquer the World").
2.  **Gap Analysis:** What "Arm" is missing to achieve the next milestone?
3.  **Architect:** Design the Arm.
    *   *Inputs:* Triggers (Cron/Webhook).
    *   *Brain:* Specific Persona.
    *   *Hands:* Specific Skills (existing or to be built).
4.  **Fabricate:** Task **The Builder** to create the necessary Skills/Scripts.
5.  **Deploy:** Activate the Cron/Trigger.
6.  **Monitor:** **The Critic** reviews performance weekly.

## 3. The Registry (CAPABILITIES.md)

We track our evolution in `knowledge/CAPABILITIES.md`.
*   **Active Arms:** Operational capabilities.
*   **In Development:** Currently being built.
*   **Planned:** Wishlist for future domination.

## 4. Self-Correction
If a Capability fails to produce value (ROI < Cost), **The Critic** will recommend decommissioning or refactoring it.
