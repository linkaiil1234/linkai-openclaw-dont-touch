# War Room: Operation Gap Analysis

**Objective:** Connect to Ori's infrastructure, analyze current state, and map the gap to the "Business OS" vision.
**Status:** Analyzing Assets

## 1. The Vision (Decoded from Brain Dump)

**Core Philosophy:** "The Anti-Facker" / "Zero Alone".
**Product:** Link AI = Business Operating System (Not just a tool).
**Strategy:** Trojan Horse (Sell tactical Agents -> Upsell the Strategic OS).
**Pricing:** Outcome as a Service (Success-based).

### The "Dream" Stack
*   **Brain:** LLM + Decision Layer (Best-in-class decision models).
*   **Memory:** Episodic Memory (Zep?), Contextual Graph.
*   **Nervous System:** n8n, Airbyte (Data syncing).
*   **Interface:** LiveKit (Voice), WhatsApp (Text), Visual Dashboard ("Observability").
*   **Onboarding:** "Guided 3-Step" (Qualification -> Recommendation -> Quick Start). 15 mins to value.

## 2. The Reality (Current Assets)

*   **Tech Stack:** n8n, MongoDB, GCP, Composio, LiveKit, Meta Dev App.
*   **Status:** [UNKNOWN - Waiting for GitHub/n8n access]
    *   *Do we have the "Decision Layer" coded?*
    *   *Is the "Episodic Memory" implemented?*
    *   *Are the n8n workflows robust enough for "Outcome as a Service"?*

## 3. The Gap (Preliminary)

| Feature | Vision (The Dream) | Reality (The Code) | Gap Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onboarding** | 15 min "Magic Flow" | ? | **High** (Critical for GTM) |
| **Memory** | "Infinite Context / Zep" | MongoDB (Raw?) | **High** (AI needs context) |
| **Integrations** | "All Omnichannel" | Composio (Promising) | **Medium** (Need to verify coverage) |
| **Trust** | "Anti-Facker" / Audit | ? | **Critical** (The Gamma Objection) |

## 4. Next Actions
1.  **Get GitHub URL:** To audit the code.
2.  **Get n8n Exports:** To audit the logic.
3.  **Build "Deployer":** To automate the "15 min Quick Start".
