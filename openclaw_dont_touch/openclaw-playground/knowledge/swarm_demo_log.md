# Swarm Operation: PROJECT KINGSLAYER [LOG]

**Target:** Salesforce (The incumbent Business OS)
**Objective:** Prove superiority of "Link AI Business OS" (Hub & Spoke) over the centralized Salesforce model.
**Status:** ARCHIVED_LOG

## Agents Deployed

1.  **🕵️‍♂️ Intel (Agent Alpha):**
    *   **Role:** Market Spy.
    *   **Task:** Dissect "Salesforce Agentforce". Find the cracks. Why do users hate it? Where is it slow? What can't it do?
    *   **Status:** ✅ Complete.
    *   **Findings:** Agentforce is "Deceptive Autonomy" (just a chatbot). Predatory pricing models lock out SMBs. Rigid scripts prevent true intelligence.

2.  **🏗️ Architect (Agent Beta):**
    *   **Role:** System Designer.
    *   **Task:** Contrast our "Mini-Link" (Google Cloud Run + n8n) model against Salesforce. Why is ours cheaper, faster, and smarter?
    *   **Status:** ⏳ Pending.

3.  **💀 The Butcher (Agent Gamma):**
    *   **Role:** Ruthless Critic.
    *   **Task:** Attack Agent Beta's plan. Why might we fail? What moat does Salesforce have?
    *   **Status:** ✅ Complete.
    *   **Findings:** "Critical Failure Likely". Managing 10k containers is a security nightmare compared to one monolith. Enterprises buy Salesforce for **Liability** and **Compliance**, not tech. We are building a "faster horse in a world of tanks".

## Synthesis (CEO)
*Pending Architect's defense.*
