# Market Domination & Trojan Horse GTM

**Agent:** Alpha (The Strategist)
**Status:** Approved

## 1. The GTM Strategy (Trojan Horse)
*   **The Wedge (Tactical):** Sell a "Phone Agent" that solves a bleeding problem (missed calls).
    *   *Pitch:* "Stop missing revenue. Answers 24/7. Books meetings."
*   **The Infection (Strategic):** The agent silently builds the CRM (contacts, logs, sentiment).
*   **The Upsell (OS):** "You have 500 contacts from calls. Unlock the full OS to close them via WhatsApp/Email."

## 2. Pricing: Outcome-as-a-Service
*   **Base:** "Keep the Lights On" (Cost+).
*   **Success Fee:** Charge per **"Link"** (A successful connection/booking).
    *   *Why:* Zero risk for the client. "Don't pay for trying. Pay for winning."

## 3. Brand: "The Anti-Facker"
*   **Enemy:** "Fake Work" (Data entry, logging calls, admin).
*   **Hero:** Link AI. "Humans do strategy. Link does the rest."
*   **Tagline:** "The End of Fake Work."

## 4. Competitor Weakness
*   **Attio/Folk:** Too empty (require setup).
*   **Day.ai:** Too radical (scary UI).
*   **Link AI:** The "Opinionated Automator". Pre-built to work, but familiar enough to trust.
