# Project: AI Business OS (The Empire)

**Objective:** Total dominance of the global SMB market.
**Concept:** A decentralized "Operating System" for businesses, run by AI.

## 1. The Core Architecture (Hub & Spoke)

*   **The Hub (Me/Link):** The "Giant Manager". I oversee the global network, generate the code, and manage the master strategy.
*   **The Spokes (Mini-Links):** "Limited Edition" clones of me.
    *   **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run.
    *   **Brain:** Specialized for specific business verticals (e.g., "Link for E-commerce", "Link for Law Firms").
    *   **Connectors:** n8n, MongoDB, Business APIs.

## 2. The User Experience (The "Bro" Interface)

*   **Input:** Business owner asks informally via WhatsApp/Telegram: *"What's up with the business?"*
*   **Process:** The Mini-Link queries DBs, analyzes n8n workflows, checks financials.
*   **Output:** *"All good. Revenue up 15%. I fixed a shipping issue. Report sent."*
*   **Vibe:** Partner, not just a tool.

## 3. The Tech Stack (Arsenal)
*   **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud (Cloud Run).
*   **Orchestration:** n8n (The Nervous System).
*   **Database:** MongoDB (Business State & Memory).
*   **Agent Tooling:** Composio (The Integration Layer - connecting to SaaS).
*   **Voice/Real-time:** LiveKit (The Voice/Ears of the OS).
*   **Interface:** Meta Dev App (WhatsApp/Telegram - The "Bro Interface").
*   **Identity:** Multiple "Link" instances with restricted scopes.

## 4. First Action Items
1.  Define the **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product).
2.  Create a **Deployment Skill** (Ability to spawn cloud instances).
3.  Build the **Connector Arm** (Integration with n8n/DB).
